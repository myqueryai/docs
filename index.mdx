## What is MyQuery?

**MyQuery** is a data platform that turns **multilingual natural-language questions** (Arabic, English, and more) into **verifiable SQL** and **clear visualizations**. Ask in your own language, review the generated query, and trust the results with built-in explainability and audit logs.

## Why MyQuery?

- **No SQL needed:** Ask in your language (Arabic, English, …) → production-grade SQL.
- **Verifiable by design:** Inspect queries, lineage, and execution logs.
- **Faster decisions:** Self-serve analytics for non-technical teams.
- **Fewer tickets:** Data teams spend less time on repetitive requests.
- **Flexible deployment:** Cloud or on-prem, with schema-only access options.
- **Broad database support:** Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, MongoDB, SQLite, MariaDB, and more.

## Getting started

### 1) Check access
You need an active **MyQuery organization** to sign in. If you’re not a customer yet, register your interest **[here](https://myquery.ai/register)**.

### 2) Sign in
Go to **[login](https://mtquery.ai/login)** and sign in with **Google** or request a **magic link** to your email.

### 3) Create your workspace
Create (or join) an organization and workspace. Invite teammates and assign roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer).

### 4) Connect a database
Add a connection using read-only credentials:
- Minimum privileges: **SELECT** on the schemas/tables you want to query.
- Recommended: **schema-only visibility** for least-privilege access.
- Supported engines include Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, MongoDB, SQLite, MariaDB, and others.

### 5) Sync schema
MyQuery scans table/column metadata to build a semantic layer (no raw data copied). You can add friendly names and descriptions to improve NL accuracy.

### 6) Ask your first question
Open **AI Query**, type a business question in **your preferred language**  
(e.g., **العربية:** *“ما هو إجمالي الإيرادات لكل منطقة خلال الربع الثاني مقارنة بالأول؟”*  
أو **English:** *“Weekly active users by country for the last 8 weeks.”*)  
Preview the **generated SQL**, then run it to view results or save a chart/dashboard.

## Tips for best results

- **Be specific:** Include metrics, time ranges, and dimensions.
- **Name things clearly:** Add descriptions/aliases for columns (e.g., `customer_id` → “Customer ID”).
- **Use read-only users:** Keep credentials scoped to the schemas you need.

## Security at a glance

- **Encryption in transit & at rest**
- **Least-privilege, schema-only access**
- **Audit logs** for queries and actions
- **On-prem deployment** option for full data residency control
