MyQuery is a data platform designed to help you automatically surface insights from any given dataset. You can communicate with Ana, our data scientist, using natural language and get verifiable analyses that range from simple queries to complex visualizations.

## Why MyQuery?

MyQuery empowers everyone in your organization to quickly derive valuable business insights without writing SQL. By translating natural language questions into correct-by-construction queries, TextQL accelerates decision-making and reduces the burden on data teams. Non-technical users can confidently explore data on their own, while data professionals save time previously spent on repetitive query writing and troubleshooting.
